# Rice Disease Detector

A Machine Learning model created to identify different types of diseases in a rice plant.

<br><br> 
This is an AI-driven diagnostic framework that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically an enhanced InceptionV3-based transfer learning modelfor multi-class classification of rice leaf diseases.
<br> The system employs advanced image preprocessing techniques, data augmentation, and class weighting to address data imbalance and improve generalization. Additionally, fine-tuning of the pre-trained model enhances performance on domain-specific imagery
<br> With a great UI this small yet complex web-app also uses google's smtp service to send emails for verification codes, reset password link, etc., and it comes along with a dashboard showing some details about the user logged in.
<br> The diagnostic pipeline integrates real-time image analysis with a Streamlit-based interface to deliver rapid, user-friendly predictions to farmers and agronomists. 
<br> Its evaluation on a labeled dataset demonstrated 97.23% accuracy, with high precision and recall.
